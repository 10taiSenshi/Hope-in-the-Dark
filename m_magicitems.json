Through an unknown means, you could store whatever you want inside its back, and grasp whatever items you need simply by thinking about it while reaching in. It makes objects about 5 times lighter when you're wearing it, but it doesn't actually make you stronger. Items inside will still weight you down.",

Amorphous, it turns to whatever tools you need to repair something. Looks extremely hobocore instead of magical, but with some proficiency in spellcasting, you can repair your magic gears. Might not work for anything else that isn't Magical Girl/Boy related, as this is magic based on pure will and feelings.",
